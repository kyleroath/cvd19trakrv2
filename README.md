# Cvd-19 Trakr V2


### Trakr

This website was created as a follow-up to my previous Covid-19 Tracker. With the global pandemic going on, I frequently found myself and peers looking for latest stats, percentages, cases per country, etc. Thankfully with the help of Mathdroid's API, this was accomplished.

More features are to be added, FAQ to be wired up as well as learn more modals on the footer features. Stable for now.
